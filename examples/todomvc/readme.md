# RibbonCables • [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)

> RibbonCables is a Typescript FRP Model-View library experiment primarily around
> signal [imuxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_multiplexer). It also
> incorporates proper signal chain resource management and layout jank reduction
> via DOM mutation batching.

## Building

```sh
> npm ci
> npm run build
```

## Running

```sh
> npm run serve
```

The app is then found at `localhost:8000`. A server is necessary to allow importing ES6 modules in
the browser.
